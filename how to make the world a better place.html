    <h1>A treatise about the unfairness of black's life</h1>
    <h5>What would you do if you were black? 
    Sit around and wait to be killed, or fight back because you know what's right?
    George Floyd didn't deserve to die. Why do people treat others differently just because of their skin tone?
    If you were jogging down the street and were about to be killed by a RETIRED police officer and his son (aka: a CIVILIAN) what would you do?
    Why do blacks have to be killed because they aren't the same as whites?
    It's horrific even to think about it
    This treatise is in memory of George Floyd and all the other blacks that have been killed by fucking police officers
