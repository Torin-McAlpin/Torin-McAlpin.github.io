    <h1>A treatise about the unfairness of black's life</h1>
    <h5>What would you do if you were black? 
    Sit around and wait to be killed, or fight back because you know what's right?</h5>
    <h5>George Floyd didn't deserve to die. Why do people treat others differently just because of their skin tone?</h5>
    <h5>If you were jogging down the street and were about to be killed by a RETIRED police officer and his son (aka: a CIVILIAN) what would you do?</h5>
    <h5>Why do blacks have to be killed because they aren't the same as whites?</h5>
    <h5>It's horrific even to think about it</h5>
    <h5>This treatise is in memory of George Floyd and all the other blacks that have been killed by fucking police officers</h5>
    </h5>
    <h5>think about it, we are tecnicly killing our self</h5>
